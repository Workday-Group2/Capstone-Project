Reflection Questions
Name at least one successful thing this week.

This week we were able to connect the front end and back end to let a user login, register, and post a donation through the website.

What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

At first, we had challenges with git and brnaching but with practice, we got the hang of it. 


Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We finished all of our tasks for this sprint plan.

Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

We used past projects and examples from previous labs to implement the backend which saved us a lot of time. We used the login, register, and post nutrition from the Lifetracker and Airbnb project as reference. We also utilized the internet with errors we've had and for styling solutions. 

Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The password reset might be a feature “at risk” and we plan on working on it together to brainstorm solutions. If that item remains "at risk" we might just move on since our project is not centered around that feature.
