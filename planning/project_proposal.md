# Project Proposal

## Problem Statement

Insert your groups problem statement and target audience.

We want to break the barrier by giving low income college students or adults the ability to receive food donations when they don't have the ability to afford them. We are also fighting food waste by giving the option for others to donate quality food items that might've gone to waste otherwise.

Target audience: People with excess food that want to donate food/those in need of quality food.

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?
